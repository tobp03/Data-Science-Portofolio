# Data Science Portofolio by Toby
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. This portfolio showcases a collection of my work in the field of data science, projects in machine learning, data analysis, and statistical modeling.

## Contents
### Machine Learning
 - [**Isolated Sign Language Recognition**](./SLR.ipynb):This project explores the fundamentals of developing an isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) model using GRU. It covers the entire pipeline, from video creation and landmark extraction using Mediapipe to model training and evaluation. The project serves as a preliminary testing ground before implementing the approach in my bachelor's final project.
 - [**Lending Risk Assessment for BNPL Using Data-Driven Modeling - January 2024**](./Lending%20Risk%20Assessment.ipynb): A data-driven approach to assess borrower risk for a fictional BNPL company using demographic analysis, K-Means clustering, and multi-class classification to evaluate repayment ability. A project for the statistics team competition held by Universitas Indonesia.
 - [**Taxi Trip Duration Prediction in New York City: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models**](./Taxi_duration.ipynb): This project analyzes and compares six machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, Generalized Linear Model, Support Vector Regression, and Ridge and Lasso regression—to predict taxi trip durations in New York City. The goal is to identify the most effective model that can help taxi companies enhance service efficiency and optimize fleet management.
 - [**Frozen Lake - Reinforcement Learning with Q-Table**](./FrozenLake.ipynb):This project explores reinforcement learning concepts using the Frozen Lake environment. Implemented with Pygame, it utilizes a Q-table to solve the environment by learning optimal policies through trial and error. This hands-on approach helped me understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, including state-action values and policy improvement.
 - [**Prediction of Divorce Rates by Applying Factor Analysis**](./Factor%20Analysis.ipynb): Aims to identify key factors contributing to divorce and enhance predictive accuracy by utilizing factor analysis in combination with logistic regression and random forests.


## Data Analysis
 - [**Clustering Analysis of Alcoholic Beverages Using Text Data**](./TextClusterAnalysis-Traditional%20Beverages.ipynb):  This project applies text-based clustering to classify traditional alcoholic beverages from 60 countries across Africa, America, Asia, and Europe using the K-Means algorithm, identifying patterns based on ingredient similarities and beverage characteristics.

 ### Data Visualization with Tableau:
 - [**All Time Successful Movies**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/toby.purbojo6009/viz/AllTimeSuccessfulMovies-FinalProject/AllTimeSuccessfulMovies): This visualization analyzes all-time successful movies by classifying them based on budget returns into categories (super hit, blockbuster, minor hit, and break-even) and further explores each group's return on investment, ratings, distribution, average budget, gross earnings, correlations, and yearly trends.
 - [**Pemerintahan**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/toby.purbojo/viz/book3backup/UTAMA): A visualization of Indonesia's demographics, highlighting the democracy index, civil servant distribution, and national budget allocation.
